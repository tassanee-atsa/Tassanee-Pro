          I settled in the UK in 2014 with my partner and became a British Citizen. After starting a family, I retrained as a full stack web developer.
I chose this path because I wanted to work in a creative field where I could solve interesting problems with other people. I applied for and successfully completed the School of Code bootcamp. It gave me the opportunity to work on several coding projects in small, collaborative teams.

          Although the bootcamp was hard and I still have a lot to learn, I really enjoyed the experience. It gave me the confidence and skills I need to start working in the industry. Iâ€™m currently looking for my first job in my new career.
